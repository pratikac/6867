_simpler_ steps to run code:

    1. get training data
    cd crawler
    python scrapeTrainingdata.py
    - this creates fml.jl, lml.jl etc.

    2. process data
    cd process
    python process_data.py
    - this creates positive.py, negative.py

    3. run svm
    cd learn
    python run_svm.py
    - this maps words to numbers and thresholds using either (a) 20 most freq words
    or (b) freq > 10, say. labels is positive if score>0
    - runs svm using these features, labels
