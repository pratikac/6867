So she asked, \"Why is everyone so friendly all of a sudden?\", to which I responded \"I'm just like that, I like helping.\"  Afterwards I told one of my manager friends the whole story of what happened and changed the ending to include everyone who works there, and that we're all friendly and like helping people out.  I laughed, not because it seemed funny to me, but because I was the one who helped her out and gave her a reason to come back shopping without even knowing, and didn't even know anything about her daughter, or that one box of cereal is the only cereal her daughter can eat.
